# External practices: what high-performing AI teams ship

> Research input for the asset harvest. This captures how leading teams —
> primarily **Anthropic** and **Cursor**, plus the community ecosystem — author and
> distribute skills and rules, distilled into conventions loadout should adopt and a
> concrete candidate asset set to fold into the harvest review.
>
> Sources are cited inline. The two most authoritative primary sources are Anthropic's
> [Claude Code best practices](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices) and
> [Skill authoring best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices),
> and Cursor's [Rules docs](https://cursor.com/docs/rules). The
> [Cursor Team Kit](https://github.com/cursor/cursor-team-kit) is a direct example of what
> Cursor itself ships.

## 1. The big picture: everyone converged on the same shape

Across Anthropic, Cursor, Codex, and the Loop Engineering methodology
(`docs/loop-engineering.md`), the building blocks are the same and load differently:

| Layer | Anthropic (Claude Code) | Cursor | loadout layer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Always-on project policy | `CLAUDE.md` (loaded every session, kept short) | `AGENTS.md` + always-apply `.mdc` | baseline / rule |
| Scoped constraints | (none native; CLAUDE.md imports) | `.mdc` rules: Always / Auto-attach / Agent-requested / Manual | rule |
| Invokable procedure | `SKILL.md` skill (`.claude/skills/`) | `SKILL.md` skill (`.cursor/skills/`) | skill |
| Repeatable command | slash command / skill with `disable-model-invocation` | `/command` | command |
| Delegated sub-task | subagent (`.claude/agents/`) | subagent (`.cursor/agents/`) | agent |
| External access | MCP server | MCP server | mcp |
| Bundled distribution | plugin + marketplace | plugin / Remote Rules | (layers A/B) |

This is exactly loadout's layer map. The research **confirms** loadout's core
architecture; the value below is in the *authoring conventions* and the *candidate content*.

---

## 2. Anthropic's conventions (the canonical rules)

### 2.1 `CLAUDE.md` — keep it short, it loads every time
From [Claude Code best practices](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices):
- Loaded at the start of **every** session, so only put things that apply broadly. For
  anything situational, use a **skill** (loaded on demand) instead.
- Litmus test per line: *"Would removing this cause Claude to make mistakes?"* If not, cut it.
  A bloated `CLAUDE.md` makes Claude **ignore** instructions.
- Include: bash commands Claude can't guess, non-default code style, test instructions,
  repo etiquette, architecture decisions, env quirks, non-obvious gotchas.
- Exclude: anything inferable from code, standard conventions, detailed API docs (link
  instead), frequently-changing info, "write clean code" platitudes.
- Supports `@path` imports; can live at `~/.claude/`, project root, `CLAUDE.local.md`
  (gitignored), and nested dirs.

### 2.2 Skill authoring (the 500-line rule and friends)
From [Skill authoring best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices):
- **Concise is key.** The context window is a public good; only add what Claude doesn't
  already know. Keep the `SKILL.md` body **under 500 lines**; split into reference files
  past that.
- **Progressive disclosure.** Metadata (name + description) is always pre-loaded; the body
  loads when triggered; reference files load only when needed. **Keep references one level
  deep** from `SKILL.md` (Claude partially reads deeply-nested files). Add a table of
  contents to reference files >100 lines.
- **Frontmatter contract:** `name` ≤64 chars, lowercase/numbers/hyphens only, no XML, no
  reserved words ("anthropic", "claude"); `description` non-empty, ≤1024 chars, **third
  person** ("Extracts…/Use when…", never "I can…"/"You can…"), with **both what it does and
  when to use it** plus key trigger terms (this is what drives selection among 100+ skills).
- **Naming:** prefer **gerund form** (`processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-spreadsheets`); avoid
  `helper`/`utils`/`tools`.
- **Degrees of freedom:** match specificity to fragility — high freedom (prose) when many
  approaches work; low freedom (exact script, "do not modify") for fragile/destructive ops.
- **Eval-driven:** build 3 evaluations *before* writing docs; baseline without the skill,
  then write the minimum to pass. Develop with "Claude A authors, Claude B uses" iteration.
- **Scripts:** prefer pre-made utility scripts over generated code (reliable, token-cheap);
  handle errors instead of punting; no "voodoo constants"; forward-slash paths only.
- **Verifiable intermediate outputs:** plan → validate → execute for batch/destructive work.

### 2.3 Verification, subagents, and the agentic loop
From the best-practices guide (these are the highest-signal workflow patterns):
- **Give Claude a check it can run** (tests/build/lint/screenshot). It's the difference
  between a session you watch and one you walk away from. Escalating gates: in-prompt → a
  `/goal` condition re-checked each turn by a separate evaluator → a deterministic Stop hook
  → a verification subagent. **Show evidence, don't assert success.**
- **Explore → plan → code → commit.** Use plan mode to separate research from
  implementation; skip planning for one-sentence diffs.
- **Maker ≠ checker.** Use a fresh **subagent** to review the diff against the plan in a
  clean context ("report gaps, not style preferences"; over-zealous reviewers cause
  over-engineering). Writer/Reviewer across two sessions; tests-first by a second agent.
- **Subagents for investigation** keep the main context clean (context is the fundamental
  constraint).
- **Manage context aggressively:** `/clear` between unrelated tasks; after two failed
  corrections, clear and re-prompt; scope investigations or delegate them.
- **Hooks** are deterministic where CLAUDE.md is advisory ("must happen every time").
- **Scale:** non-interactive `claude -p` for CI/pipelines; parallel sessions via worktrees;
  fan-out loops over file lists with `--allowedTools` scoping.

### 2.4 Anthropic's own taxonomy of skills
Anthropic ships skills grouped as **document handling** (pdf/docx/xlsx/pptx),
**data fetching/analysis**, and **workflow** skills, plus a built-in **`skill-creator`**
(reuse it as the base for our `skill-author`) and a bundled **`/code-review`** skill that
reviews the current diff in a fresh subagent.

## 3. Cursor's conventions (rules, first-class)

From [Cursor Rules docs](https://cursor.com/docs/rules):
- **Four rule types**, set by frontmatter:

  | `alwaysApply` | `description` | `globs` | Behavior |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `true` | — | — | Always included (globs/description ignored) |
  | `false` | — | provided | Auto-attached when a matching file is in context |
  | `false` | provided | omitted | Agent pulls it in when relevant (needs a good description) |
  | `false` | omitted | omitted | Manual only, via `@`-mention |

- **Best practices:** keep rules **under 500 lines**; split large rules into composable
  ones; **reference files (`@file`) instead of pasting** (prevents staleness); write like
  clear internal docs; reuse instead of re-prompting.
- **What to avoid:** copying whole style guides (use a linter — the agent knows common
  conventions); documenting every command; edge-case instructions; duplicating code that
  exists (point to canonical examples). *Start simple; add a rule only when the agent
  repeats a mistake.*
- **Tiers & precedence:** Team Rules → Project Rules → User Rules (merged; earlier wins on
  conflict). **AGENTS.md** is the plain-markdown alternative, supported nested per-directory
  with more-specific taking precedence.
- **Remote Rules:** import `.mdc` from any GitHub repo; auto-sync. (This is loadout's Layer B
  distribution mechanism.)
- `.md` files in `.cursor/rules` are **ignored** — project rules must be `.mdc` with
  frontmatter; use `AGENTS.md` for plain markdown.

### 3.1 What Cursor ships in the Team Kit
The [Cursor Team Kit](https://github.com/cursor/cursor-team-kit) (CI/review/shipping
workflows, "plug and play, no third-party services") ships **18 skills, 2 rules, 2 agents**:

- **Skills:** `loop-on-ci`, `review-and-ship`, `pr-review-canvas`, `verify-this`,
  `control-cli`, `control-ui`, `make-pr-easy-to-review`, `run-smoke-tests`, `fix-ci`,
  `new-branch-and-pr`, `get-pr-comments`, `check-compiler-errors`, `what-did-i-get-done`,
  `weekly-review`, `fix-merge-conflicts`, `deslop`, `workflow-from-chats`,
  `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`.
- **Agents:** `ci-watcher`, `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`.
- **Rules:** `typescript-exhaustive-switch`, `no-inline-imports`.

Notable shape: each skill is a tight `SKILL.md` with `## Trigger`, `## Workflow` (numbered),
`## Suggested Checks` (copy-paste commands), and `## Guardrails`. This is a good house style
for loadout skills.

---

## 4. The community ecosystem (breadth check)

- **Subagent taxonomy** ([VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents),
  100+ agents) groups specialists into: core-development, language-specialists,
  infrastructure, quality & security, data & AI, developer-experience, specialized-domains,
  business & product, meta & orchestration, research & analysis. Useful as a checklist of
  agent roles worth having.
- Curated skill indexes: [ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills),
  [hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code),
  [VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills) (cross-tool).
- Public vendor skill packs (Vercel, Stripe, Cloudflare, Clerk, Resend, Supabase, Webflow,
  Notion, Hugging Face) show the **plugin-of-skills** model in production and are good
  structural references — not content to copy.
- **Caveat (inbound trust):** community skills are an injection surface. Treat
  collections as inspiration for *what* to build, author our own, and run the `doctor`
  injection lint on anything pulled in.

## 5. How this reconciles with loadout

Mostly **confirmation** — the research validates the layer model, SKILL.md-as-unit,
plugin=shipping, skills-vs-MCP, native rails, and the maker/checker + verification-gate
patterns already folded in from the Loop Engineering pass. New, concrete tightenings:

| # | Change | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Adopt canonical **skill frontmatter rules** (gerund `name` ≤64/lowercase-hyphen/no reserved words; third-person `description` ≤1024 with what+when) | `skill-author`, doctor | **done** (doctor) |
| 2 | Enforce the **500-line `SKILL.md` body** rule and **one-level-deep references** as the size guidance (replaces the vague soft limit) | `skill-author`, doctor | **done** (doctor warns >500 lines) |
| 3 | Adopt **CLAUDE.md hygiene** ("would removing this cause a mistake?"; situational → skill) as a baseline/template convention | templates | **later** (template) |
| 4 | House style for skills: `## Trigger` / `## Workflow` / `## Suggested Checks` / `## Guardrails` (+ existing `## Pairs with`) | `skill-author` | **later** (skill-author) |
| 5 | Rules: enforce "reference files, don't paste"; "what to avoid" (no style-guide dumps, use a linter) as `rule-author` guidance | `rule-author` | **later** |
| 6 | Seed a **verification/eval** convention (give a check; show evidence; plan→validate→execute; build evals first) | workflows, runbooks | **later** |

(Items 1–2 are implemented in `doctor` now; the rest are authored during the harvest.)

---

## 6. Candidate asset set (pre-build plan — SUPERSEDED)

> **This is the original brainstorm, not the shipped set.** Names here are provisional and
> some candidates were renamed, merged, or never built. The authoritative, current list of
> what actually ships is **`registry.json`** (and `docs/catalog.md`). Read this section as
> historical planning only.

These were **generalized, public-safe** candidates synthesized from the sources above.

### Skills (plugin: `core-engineering` unless noted)

### Meta skills (plugin: `meta`)
| id | What / when |
|---|---|
| `skill-author` | Scaffold a SKILL.md to our conventions (frontmatter rules §2.2, progressive disclosure, house style, `Pairs with`); seeded from Anthropic `skill-creator` |
| `rule-author` | Scaffold an `.mdc` rule (correct type/frontmatter, "reference don't paste", "what to avoid"); reminds when it should be a skill |
| `learning-from-chats` | Extract durable preferences from recent chats → skills/rules/AGENTS.md |

### Reporting skills (plugin: `reporting`)
`summarizing-my-work` (what-did-i-get-done), `weekly-review`.

### Rules (`.mdc`, flat in `rules/`)

|---|---|---|
| `base-conventions` | always (or AGENTS.md) | stack, voice, naming, do/don'ts — kept short |
| `verify-before-done` | always | always provide a check; show evidence; never ship unverified |
| `context-hygiene` | agent-requested | `/clear` between tasks; scope/delegate investigations |
| `claude-md-hygiene` | agent-requested | keep CLAUDE.md short; situational → skill |
| `commit-and-pr-etiquette` | agent-requested | branch naming, conventional commits, PR conventions |
| `no-inline-imports` | always | (from team kit) imports at top |

| `audit-external-skills` | agent-requested | review third-party skills before install (inbound trust) |
| `<stack>-conventions` | auto by glob | rails / workers / react — **project-specific; not shipped here** |

### Agents (subagents)
| id | Role |
|---|---|
| `reviewer` | Maker/checker diff reviewer; "report gaps, not style" |
| `security-reviewer` | Injection/authz/secret review; strong model, high effort |
| `explorer` | Read-only codebase investigation, returns summaries |

| `code-quality` | Strict maintainability rubric (thermo-nuclear style) |

### Workflows (`processes/workflows/`)
| name | Composes |
|---|---|
| `ship-a-feature` | base-conventions + planning-a-change → reviewing-and-shipping → reviewer; gate=tests/lint |
| `fix-ci-until-green` | looping-on-ci + fixing-ci + ci-watcher; stop_condition=checks green |
| `cut-a-release` | cutting-a-release + changelog command |
| `onboard` | onboarding-to-a-codebase + explorer |

> Note: this section is the original pre-build candidate plan (provisional names). The
> actual shipped set is in `registry.json` and is **general-purpose only** — domain/vertical
> candidates (SMS/telephony, media/streaming, ML eval/training, MCP-tool authoring) were
> intentionally left out to keep loadout broadly reusable.

### Runbooks / templates (from Loop Engineering, per decision C2)
4-condition test, 30-second loop check, Ralph-Wiggum self-test, security-tax checklist;
`STATE.md` and automation starter templates.
