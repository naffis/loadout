description: Shortcut to decide how to proceed on a goal and get a ready-to-run kickoff prompt.
---

Run the `getting-started` skill for the user's goal: $ARGUMENTS

1. If no goal was given, ask one line: "What do you want to build or do?"
2. Follow `getting-started`: clarify the goal (interview briefly only if vague), orient with `onboard-to-codebase` if the repo is unfamiliar, classify the work, route to the right workflow + supporting skills/rules, and decide manual vs autonomous loop via `loop-preflight`.
3. Output a short recommendation plus a concrete, paste-ready **kickoff prompt** (naming the workflow, the gate command, and the done-condition).

Keep it brief — this is an entry point, not the work itself.
