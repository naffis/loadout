description: End-of-session review-and-FIX — ask vs ship, class-kill, sibling sweep, independent checker.
---

Run the `post-flight` skill in full. The session's work is claimed done (or nearly
done). Prove it against evidence and **fix** what the proof turns up — do not
only report.

## Process (do not skip)

0. Ground truth — verbatim asks, git artifact list, deferral inventory.
1. Requirements matrix — asked vs shipped (and inverse scope check).
2. Adversarial re-read of every session-owned changed file + callers.
3. Shortcut sweep with per-pattern hit counts (including zeros).
4. Fix-correctness matrix (`references/fix-correctness-audit.md`) — escalate
   bandaid / wrong-layer / unproven via `root-cause-fix`.
5. Sibling surface sweep (`references/sibling-surface-sweep.md`) — pattern
   self-validate first; callers before clones.
6. Definition-of-Done walk for triggered rows.
7. Project gate commands with pasted output.
8. Fix loop — deferred work done by default; re-attest Steps 4–5 on fixes.
9. Independent checker (`references/independent-checker.md`) — fresh context,
   read-only; CLEAN requires PASS (or docs-only N/A).
10. Post-flight report with full coverage accounting.
11. Last — emit this fence and nothing after it. A `## Next` sentence is
    incomplete:

```text
verifying-session-surfaces: <CLEAN + unharvested user-visible change + enough context>

Specimen: <plan path / issue id — omit if none>
Root node: <file:symbol or layer — omit if a plan>
Class / slice: <siblings or smallest validating slice>
Out of scope: …
Do not implement a proximate patch. Follow the named skill in full.
```

Do not commit/push/PR unless explicitly asked. Prefer `review-build` when the
ask is a fresh-chat grade against a written plan rather than maker fix-mode.
