# Clear the queue

Fan out independent work items across isolated git worktrees, cap concurrency to review
bandwidth, and serialize landing. This is the named recipe around
`orchestrating-parallel-agents` — use it when the user says "do these in parallel", "knock
out the next N", or "clear the queue." Do **not** use it for one coupled feature (`ship-a-feature`
/ `plan-then-build`) or one long loop (`run-autonomous-loop`).

**Equip note:** each parallel item still needs a per-item procedure. This `uses:` block
includes `running-a-dev-cycle` + planning/tests/shipping primitives. If items are ordinary
features, also vendor `ship-a-feature`'s remaining pieces (or the full `ship-a-feature`
workflow kit). If an item is high-stakes, run it alone via `plan-then-build` instead of
parallelizing it.

1. **Build the work set** — enumerate items with acceptance criteria and likely file touch
   sets. Write them into the state file. **Any two items that touch overlapping files must
   sequence, not parallelize.** If unsure, sequence. Confirm the set and chosen concurrency
   with the user when the request was vague or the set is large.
2. **Cap concurrency hard** — 1 item → run inline (`running-a-dev-cycle` / `ship-a-feature`),
   no orchestration. 2–3 → parallel. More than 3 → waves of at most 3. Never exceed the cap;
   ten unreviewed diffs are worse than two reviewed ones (`docs/agentic-patterns.md`
   over-parallelization).
3. **Isolate** — one git worktree + branch per parallel item. Sub-agents work only in their
   worktree path, never the main checkout. Follow `orchestrating-parallel-agents` for the
   exact commands and prompt shape.
4. **Launch self-contained sub-agents** — each prompt must include: absolute worktree path,
   full task + acceptance criteria, procedure pointer (`running-a-dev-cycle` or
   `ship-a-feature`), hard rules (`no-shortcuts`, gate must stay green, stop before landing),
   and "edits unstaged / no merge unless the user already authorized landing." Shared
   bookkeeping (issue tracker, PR comments) stays with the orchestrator.
5. **Land serially, gated by maker≠checker** — as each item reports green:
   1. Dispatch `reviewer` (and `security-reviewer` when the item touches auth, input, data
      access, secrets, or external calls) against that item's acceptance contract.
   2. On a failing verdict, send findings back to that item's maker — do not land.
   3. `rebasing-a-branch` onto the latest base; re-run the gate **after** the rebase.
   4. Merge/open the PR only if the user asked (`commit-and-pr-conventions`); otherwise
      present branch + verdict.
   5. Finish one landing before starting the next so the next rebases on the newer base.
   6. Remove the worktree when the item is fully done.
6. **Base goes red → stop new landings** — fix forward on the shared base before continuing.
   Never weaken tests to unblock the queue.
7. **Report** — keep a status table in the state file (item / branch / gate / checker /
   landed). End with exactly what remains, why, and what you need from the user.

Never let sub-agents merge concurrently. Never parallelize overlapping edits. Never land
without a SAFE checker verdict and a green post-rebase gate.
