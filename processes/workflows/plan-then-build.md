# Plan then build

The high-rigor path for non-trivial, unfamiliar, or high-stakes work: a complete
zero-shortcut plan, an adversarial plan review, implementation, then an
evidence-first build review. Prefer this over `ship-a-feature` when a shallow
sketch would leave decisions to coding time. Prefer `ship-a-feature` for ordinary,
well-understood changes where `planning-a-change`'s short plan is enough. Prefer
`run-autonomous-loop` only after `loop-preflight` passes and you want unattended
execution against a contract.

Slash shortcuts: `/plan` → create the plan; `/review-plan` → stress-test it;
`/complete-the-build` → exhaust open Partial/Missing/Punted rows;
`/review-build` → verify the implementation; `/post-flight` → same-session
fix-mode wrap (sibling sweep + deferred work) when the user asks. Prefer
`/review-plan` and `/review-build` in a **fresh chat** when the stakes are high
(maker ≠ checker).

**Equip note:** `uses.rules` lists registry rule ids (`create-plan-rule`,
`review-plan-rule`, `complete-the-build-rule`, `review-build-rule`) — those are
what `loadout add` installs. The skill ids (`create-plan`, `review-plan`,
`complete-the-build`, `review-build`) are separate and also required.

1. **Frame** — write the outcome, constraints, non-goals, and verifiable done-condition into
   the state file. If the repo is unfamiliar, run `onboard-to-codebase` first. Do not write
   implementation code in this step.
2. **Create the plan** — `create-plan` (`/plan`) in full: in-repo evidence first, mandatory
   external research (SOTA / common practice / pitfalls / primary sources), EARS-style
   acceptance criteria, mini-ADRs for real trade-offs, executable tasks. Ban TBD, stubs,
   placeholders, and "figure out during implementation" for anything in scope
   (`create-plan-rule` + `no-shortcuts`).
3. **Stress-test the plan** — `review-plan` (`/review-plan`) in full: re-read plan + live
   code, fresh external research, PASS/FAIL checklist with evidence, pre-mortem, adversarial
   critique, fix shortcuts **in the plan file**, final sweep. Chat-only critique without
   editing the plan is a failure (`review-plan-rule`). Do not implement until the plan
   verdict is APPROVED or APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS (conditions listed and accepted).
4. **Implement against the plan** — smallest safe change first; follow existing patterns;
   update the plan if reality diverges (the plan stays the source of truth). No side quests.
5. **Exhaust open rows** — if any plan phase/AC is still Partial / Missing / Punted,
   run `complete-the-build` (`/complete-the-build`): gap matrix before coding, build to
   empty, two clean passes (`complete-the-build-rule`). Do not jump to review-build with
   open rows.
6. **Test** — `writing-tests` (or `test-driven` / `/tdd` when the user wants the hard
   loop): new behavior, edges, error paths (`test-coverage`); any bug found mid-build
   gets a fail-before/pass-after test (`regression-test`).
7. **Verify** — run the `gate`; show the evidence. Optional clarity pass:
   `simplifying-code` (`/simplify`) on the diff before review.
8. **Docs in the same change** — `updating-docs` for every surface the change altered
   (`documentation-updates`, `definition-of-done`).
9. **Review the build** — `review-build` (`/review-build`): ground-truth diff, plan/requirement
   trace, shortcut sweep, gate with pasted output, fix blockers/majors. Prefer a fresh chat.
   Do not proceed on FAIL (`review-build-rule`).
10. **Maker ≠ checker** — dispatch the `reviewer` agent on the diff **vs the approved plan**.
    Fix correctness/intent gaps; ignore over-engineering suggestions that reopen decided ADRs
    without new evidence.
11. **Commit & PR** — `writing-commit-messages`, then `opening-a-pr` with a validation-first
    description. For a noisy/large diff, `making-a-pr-reviewable` first. Only if the user
    asked (`commit-and-pr-conventions`).

Run steps 4–10 as verified loops (`agentic-loop`): stop contract, ground-truth verify, edits
left unstaged. Never start step 4 with an incomplete plan, never skip `review-plan` on work
that justified `create-plan`, and never skip `review-build` before calling the change done.
